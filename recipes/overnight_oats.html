        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Overnight oats are the perfect healthy breakfast to meal prep for busy mornings. Here you'll find my base overnight oats recipe and my favorite variations.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup old fashioned rolled oats</li>
                <li>½ cup milk (I like unsweetened almond milk)</li>
                <li>¼ cup plain Greek yogurt (or ¼ cup more milk)</li>
                <li>1-2 teaspoons maple syrup or honey (or your preferred sweetener)</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chia seeds (optional)</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)</li>
                <li>pinch of sea salt</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add oats, milk, yogurt, maple syrup, chia seeds, vanilla and sea salt into a jar or storage container with a lid. Stir ingredients together. Place in the fridge overnight. If you're in a rush you can shorten the soak time to 2-4 hours.</li>
                <li>The next morning (or when ready to eat), remove lid and give oats a big stir. If they seem too thick you can add a little more milk to loosen the mixture. Top with your favorite toppings and enjoy. You can eat the oats straight from the jar or pour into a bowl for serving.</li>
            </ol>
