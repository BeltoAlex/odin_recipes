                <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil (canola, sunflower etc.)</li>
                <li>vegetable oil  (for frying depending on the size of your pan)</li>
                <li>1 large orange (you'll need the juice and zest)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup rice vinegar (or white vinegar)</li>
                <li>½ cup brown sugar (packed)</li>
                <li>2 large garlic cloves (minced, or 1 tsp garlic powder)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (mixed with 1 tbsp water)</li>
                <li>sesame seeds</li>
                <li>green onions (chopped)</li>
                <li>red pepper flakes</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <h3>Chicken</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut chicken into 1-inch cubes.</li>
                    <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the flour, cornstarch, salt and pepper. Add the egg, oil and water, whisking until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken cubes to the mixture, making sure the chicken gets thoroughly coated. Cover and chill for 30 minutes in the fridge. (If you're in a hurry, 10 minutes will do.)</li>
                    <li>In a medium saucepan or deep fryer, add 2 inches of oil and heat to 350˚F (177˚C). Line a plate with paper towels and set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the marinated chicken cubes in batches of about 10-15 pieces, shaking off excess batter if needed. Deep fry for 2-3 minutes until golden, turning halfway through with a slotted spoon for even browning.**</li>
                    <li>Remove to the plate and cover with foil to keep warm while you make the sauce.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Sauce</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>To a medium saucepan, add orange juice, orange zest, soy sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, and garlic.</li>
                    <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and bring to a low boil. Carefully taste a few drops and adjust sugar, soy sauce and vinegar to suit your preference.</li>
                    <li>Mix the cornstarch and water in a cup to make a slurry and pour into the sauce. Stir constantly until the sauce coats the back of a spoon. (This can take as little as 30 seconds or as long as several minutes.)</li>
                    <li>Add the fried chicken and toss until the sauce coats it thoroughly.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with optional sesame seeds, green onions and red pepper flakes. Serve immediately.</li>
                </ol>
