        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>With tender swirls of silky egg suspended in a simple broth, this became a staple in my college cooking repertoire when I needed comfort food on a budget. Sometimes egg drop soup would be my entire meal, but other times I would pair it with a side of stir-fried greens or frozen or homemade pot stickers. A hot, satisfying bowl of Chinese egg drop soup was something I could throw together in just 10 minutes, and hereâ€™s how you can do it, too.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>32-ounce low-sodium chicken broth (4 cups), divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground white pepper, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>3  large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>Soy sauce or tamari (optional)</li>
            <li>1 medium scallion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour 1/4 cup from 1 (32-ounce) carton low-sodium chicken broth into a liquid measuring cup. Stir in 3 tablespoons cornstarch until the cornstarch is suspended. Pour the remaining 3 3/4 cups chicken broth into a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Add 1/2 teaspoon toasted sesame oil, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1 pinch ground white pepper, and stir to combine. Give the cornstarch mixture another stir. While stirring the broth continuously, slowly pour in the cornstarch mixture. Simmer, stirring often, until thickened slightly, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to the lowest setting. While stirring slowly and gently in the same direction, pour in 3 beaten large eggs. Remove the saucepan from the heat. Let sit for 1 minute for the eggs to finish setting. Taste and season with more kosher salt, white pepper, or a little soy sauce as needed. Garnish with 1 thinly sliced medium scallion if desired.</li>
        </ol>
